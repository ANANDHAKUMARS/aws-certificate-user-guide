# What Is AWS Certificate Manager?<a name="acm-overview"></a>

AWS Certificate Manager \(ACM\) handles the complexity of creating and managing SSL/TLS certificates for your AWS based websites and applications\. You can use [certificates provided by ACM](gs-acm-request.md) \(ACM Certificates\) or [ certificates that you import into ACM](import-certificate.md)\. ACM Certificates can secure multiple domain names and multiple names within a domain\. You can also use ACM to create wildcard SSL certificates that can protect an unlimited number of subdomains\. 

**Note**  
You cannot install an ACM Certificate directly on your website or application\. You must install your certificate by using one of the services integrated with ACM\. For more information about these services, see [Services Integrated with AWS Certificate Manager](acm-services.md)\.
